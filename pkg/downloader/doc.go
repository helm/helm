// Package artifact provides unified downloading and verification for Helm artifacts.
//
// This package implements a generic artifact downloader that works with charts,
// plugins, and future artifact types. It uses the transport package for
// protocol abstraction and provides unified verification via provenance files.
//
// The core Downloader type handles:
// - Repository resolution (reponame/artifact â†’ URL)
// - Protocol abstraction via transports
// - Content-addressable caching
// - Provenance file verification
// - Artifact naming conventions
//
// Type-specific convenience wrappers (ChartDownloader, PluginDownloader) provide
// backward-compatible APIs while using the unified implementation.
