Package chartutil contains tools for working with charts.

Charts are described in the chart package (pkg/chart).
This package provides utilities for serializing and deserializing charts.

A chart can be represented on the file system in one of two ways:

  - As a directory that contains a Chart.yaml file and other chart things.
  - As a tarred gzipped file containing a directory that then contains a
    Chart.yaml file.

This package provides utilities for working with those file formats.

The preferred way of loading a chart is using 'loader.Load`:

	chart, err := loader.Load(filename)

This will attempt to discover whether the file at 'filename' is a directory or
a chart archive. It will then load accordingly.

For accepting raw compressed tar file data from an io.Reader, the
'loader.LoadArchive()' will read in the data, uncompress it, and unpack it
into a Chart.

When creating charts in memory, use the 'helm.sh/helm/pkg/chart'
package directly.
