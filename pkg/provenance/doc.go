Package provenance provides tools for establishing the authenticity of a chart.

In Helm, provenance is established via several factors. The primary factor is the
cryptographic signature of a chart. Chart authors may sign charts, which in turn
provide the necessary metadata to ensure the integrity of the chart file, the
Chart.yaml, and the referenced Docker images.

A provenance file is clear-signed. This provides cryptographic verification that
a particular block of information (Chart.yaml, archive file, images) have not
been tampered with or altered. To learn more, read the GnuPG documentation on
clear signatures:
https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html

The cryptography used by Helm should be compatible with OpenGPG. For example,
you should be able to verify a signature by importing the desired public key
and using `gpg --verify`, `keybase pgp verify`, or similar:

	$  gpg --verify some.sig
	gpg: Signature made Mon Jul 25 17:23:44 2016 MDT using RSA key ID 1FC18762
	gpg: Good signature from "Helm Testing (This key should only be used for testing. DO NOT TRUST.) <helm-testing@helm.sh>" [ultimate]
