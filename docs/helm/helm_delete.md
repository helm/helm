## helm delete

given a release name, delete the release from Kubernetes

### Synopsis



This command takes a release name, and then deletes the release from Kubernetes.
It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be deleted without actually
deleting them.


```
helm delete [flags] RELEASE_NAME [...]
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run       simulate a delete
      --no-hooks      prevent hooks from running during deletion
      --purge         remove the release from the store and make its name free for later use
      --timeout int   time in seconds to wait for any individual kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 300)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --debug                     enable verbose output
